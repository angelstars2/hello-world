# hello-world

my name is Patriceia, (yes that's the correct spelling)
and i took an "introduction to computer programming" course
as an elective, and it sparked my interest in programming!

i am a architectural studies, technology specialist
at the university of toronto, and in a sense buildings
are like programs in the physical world with their own
functions and paths; inputs and outputs.

i hope that i continue to learn and experience a variety
of programs, and that it can enrich my own studies in
university and beyond.

thanks for visiting my github!
